## Abstract

We perform direct numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the early universe and numerically compute the resulting stochastic background of gravitational waves and relic
magnetic fields. These simulations do not make the simplifying assumptions of earlier analytic
work. If the turbulence is assumed to have an energy-carrying scale that is about a hundredth
of the Hubble radius at the time of generation, as expected in a first-order phase transition, the
peak of gravitational wave power will be in the mHz frequency range for a signal produced at the
electroweak scale. The efficiency of gravitational wave (GW) production varies significantly with
how the turbulence is driven. Detectability of turbulence at the electroweak scale by the planned
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) requires anywhere from 0.5% to 10% of the thermal
plasma energy density to be in plasma motions or magnetic fields, depending on the model of the
driving process. Our results predict a new universal form below the spectral peak frequency that
is shallower than previously thought. This implies larger values of the GW energy spectra in the
low-frequency range. This extends the range where turbulence is detectable with LISA to lower
frequencies, corresponding to higher energy scales than the assumed energy-carrying scale.
