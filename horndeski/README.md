## Abstract

We study the propagation of cosmological gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds
produced in the early radiation era until the present day in modified theories of gravity.
Compared to general relativity (GR), we study the effects that Horndeski parameters, such
as the run rate of the effective Planck mass $\alpha_{\rm M}$ and the tensor speed excess
$\alpha_{\rm T}$, have on the
present-day GW spectrum using the WKB estimate, which provides an analytical description
but fails at superhorizon scales, and numerical simulations that allows us to go beyond the
WKB approximation. We show that $\alpha_{\rm T}$ makes relatively insignificant changes to the GR
solution, especially taking into account the constraints on its value from GW observations by
the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, while $\alpha_{\rm M}$ can introduce modifications to the spectral slopes of
the GW energy spectrum in the low-frequency regime depending on the considered time evo-
lution parameterization of $\alpha_{\rm M}$. This effect is additional to the damping or growth occurring
equally at all scales that can be predicted by the WKB approximation. We discuss the observational
implications in light of the recent observations by pulsar timing array collaborations
and future detectors such as SKA, LISA, and DECIGO.
