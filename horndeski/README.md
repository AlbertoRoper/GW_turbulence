## Abstract

We study the propagation of cosmological gravitational wave (GW)
backgrounds from the early radiation era until the present day in
modified theories of gravity.
Comparing to general relativity (GR),
we study the effects that Horndeski parameters, such as
the run rate of the effective Planck mass $\alpM$
and the tensor speed excess $\alpT$,
have on the present-day GW spectrum.
We use both the WKB estimate, which provides
an analytical description but fails at superhorizon scales, and numerical
simulations that allow us to go beyond the WKB approximation.
We show that $\alpT$ makes relatively insignificant changes to the GR solution,
especially taking into account the constraints on its value from GW 
observations by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, while
$\alpM$ can introduce modifications to the spectral slopes of the GW
energy spectrum in the low-frequency regime
depending on the considered time evolution of $\alpM$.
The latter effect is additional to the damping or growth
occurring equally at all scales that can be predicted by the WKB approximation.
In light of the recent observations by pulsar timing array 
collaborations and future detectors such as SKA, LISA, DECIGO, BBO, or ET,
we show that, in most of the cases, constraints can not be placed on the effects of $\alpM$ 
and the initial GW energy density $\EEGW^\*$ separately, but only on the combined effects of the two.
