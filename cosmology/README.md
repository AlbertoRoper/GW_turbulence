The directory 'cosmology' contains files with numerical values
relevant for cosmology calculations.

- The jupyter notebook cosmology.ipynb contains a tutorial to solve
Friedmann equations and obtain the results applied to study the
evolution of the Universe through radiation domination, matter
domination, and dark-energy domination eras.

- The jupyter notebook cosmology_PC.ipynb contains the instructions
to generate the required files to be used by the Pencil Code regarding
the cosmological history of the Universe, which is first produced
from the Friedmann solver in cosmology.ipynb and cosmology.py

- 'T_gs.csv' contains the relativistic and adiabatic degrees of
freedom as a function of the temperature scale in the early
universe.
