This directory contains numerical values of the sensitivities of
different detectors to gravitational wave (GW) signals.

The sensitivities (given in ratio of GW energy density to
present time critical energy density, Omega_GW) and power
law sensitivities (PLS) for LISA and Taiji have been computed
using the routine
[interferometry.py](https://github.com/AlbertoRoper/GW_turbulence/blob/master/interferometry.py),
following the methodology of the appendix B in:

of gravitational waves from helical MHD turbulent sources," JCAP, in press
(2022) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05356.pdf).
