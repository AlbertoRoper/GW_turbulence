This directory contains numerical values of the sensitivities of
different detectors to gravitational wave (GW) signals.

- The sensitivities (given in ratio of GW energy density to
present time critical energy density, Omega_GW) and power
law sensitivities (PLS) for LISA and Taiji are computed
using the routine
[interferometry.py](https://github.com/AlbertoRoper/GW_turbulence/blob/master/interferometry.py),
following the methodology of the appendix B in:
A. Roper Pol, S. Mandal, A. Brandenburg, T. Kahniashvili, "Polarization
of gravitational waves from helical MHD turbulent sources," JCAP 04 (2022), 019,
[arXiv:2107.05356](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05356).
