This GitHub project produces results related to the MHD turbulence production of cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds.
The routines use results from large-scale numerical simulations, which are performed using the Pencil Code (https://github.com/pencil-code);
see [Pencil Code Collaboration] ``The Pencil Code, a modular MPI code for partial differential equations and particles: multipurpose and multiuser-maintained,''
J. Open Source Softw. 6, 2807 (2021) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08231).

If you use any of the results presented within this project, please cite the relevant reference and the Pencil Code paper.

If you have any issues, comments, suggestions, or you are just interested in discussing any of the presented results you can contact me: roperpol@apc.in2p3.fr
